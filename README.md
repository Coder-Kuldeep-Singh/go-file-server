Additional Considerations:

1. How can we handle potential security concerns associated with user interaction with files and folders?
A: By sanitizing the path and only allowing user to access only allowed root(custom) folder.


2. What error handling mechanisms should be implemented to ensure a smooth user experience?
A: If using the templating within backend language, backend should share the errors to frontend as well for better user experience.

4. How can we improve the user interface for a more intuitive browsing and editing experience?
A: The UI needs to be easy to understand and also accesible, like kinda adding a back button so user won't just get stuck into a direcetory, also introducing the back root directory button as well so user can jump back to it as well.
